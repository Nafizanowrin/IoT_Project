## Features

- Real-time data collection from simulated sensors
- Logging sensor data for further analysis
- Basic control of connected devices
- Modular codebase for easy extension

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- MQTT / HTTP Protocols (depending on your simulation)
- Sensor simulation libraries
- Basic automation logic

--- 

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nafizanowrin/IoT_Project.git
   cd IoT_Project

2. Install dependencies (if any)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the main script
   python main.py
4. Observe the outputs
  Sensor readings will be printed/logged, and device actions will be simulated.

## Future Improvements

  - Integrate with real IoT devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, ESP32)
  - Add cloud connectivity (e.g., AWS IoT Core, Azure IoT Hub)
  - Build a dashboard to visualize sensor data
  - Implement alert notifications
